## why use OOP?

## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototype
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## Pillars of OOPS
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## 'new' Keyword
- When we use *new* keyword, it first creates a empty instance(object).
- a constructor function is called due to *new* keyword, it packs all the arguments are passed on.
- all the things getting added to the *this*
- and you are good to go.
